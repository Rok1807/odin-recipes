    <h2>Ewa Agoyin</h2>
    <p>Ewa Agoyin is a delicious pepper sauce that is made in Yoruba land and usually served with well-cooked beans</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of dried crushed chilies/peppers</li>
        <li>1 white onion</li>
        <li>Large red onion (one)</li>
        <li>1 Seasoning cube</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>

        <li>2 cups palm oil</li>
        <li>3 cups of beans/black-eyed peas</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice half of the red onion and combine the remaining half with the white onions, pepper, a cup of water and
            blend.</li>
        <li>Set your cooking pot on heat, add the two cups of palm oil and allow heating, but don’t let it bleach. About
            3 minutes should do it.Throughout the cooking process, you don’t let it bleach when making ewa agoyin
            The red color is just what set’s it apart from the regular tomato stew.

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Once the oil is heated you can add the sliced red onions.</p>

            <p>Fry the onion for about 3 minutes before adding the ground pepper/chillie, onions and water combination
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Now you fry.

        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>This pepper sauce is not like the regular tomato stew, so you would fry for the next 15-25 minutes.</p>
